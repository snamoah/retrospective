# Retrospective

This app is inspired by [@pepf](https://github.com/pepf)'s Retrospectify. Here's a link to his [version](https://github.com/pepf/retrospectify).

I found this project particularly interesting as in our company we've been having retrospective meetings. Due to covid, collaboration during 
these meetings is often via Google Docs. So I was curious to build a app that'll provide a much better UX.
